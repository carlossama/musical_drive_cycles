# musical_drive_cycles
I got bored at work and wondered what the US06 drive cycle sounded like. Here it is...

The program takes the discrete cosine transform of the input signal (US06 in this case), grabs the frequency components that contribute the most to the cosine approximation, and plays it as the closest notes on the A440 musical range. Headphones are recommended so your friends don't think you're an alien.
